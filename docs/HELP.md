# What is Lightning Network
The Lightning Network (LN) is a "layer 2" payment protocol layered on top of Bitcoin (and other blockchains and cryptocurrencies).[1] It is intended to enable fast transactions among participating nodes and has been proposed as a solution to the bitcoin scalability problem.[2][3] It features a peer-to-peer system for making micropayments of cryptocurrency through a network of bidirectional payment channels without delegating custody of funds.
